## Overview

Developed a comprehensive web platform for a vehicle refurbishment business that showcases restored motorcycles and cars. The application features real-time inventory management, detailed vehicle listings, and secure payment processing, all powered by Firebase's backend services.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Inventory Management**: Built a real-time inventory system using Firebase Firestore, allowing immediate updates of vehicle listings, prices, and availability status.
- **Rich Media Galleries**: Implemented an image management system that displays high-quality photos and 360Â° views of refurbished vehicles, optimized for fast loading.
- **User Authentication**: Integrated Firebase Authentication for secure user accounts, allowing customers to save favorites and track their inquiries.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Created a comprehensive admin panel for managing listings, tracking inquiries, and updating vehicle status with before/after restoration photos.
- **Payment Integration**: Implemented secure payment processing using Stripe, with support for deposits and full payments.

## Technologies Used

- **React & Next.js**: For building a fast, SEO-friendly frontend interface
- **Firebase Suite**:
  - Firestore: For real-time database management
  - Authentication: For user management
  - Storage: For media file handling
  - Hosting: For deployment
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive design implementation
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe code development

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was creating an efficient image management system that could handle multiple high-quality photos while maintaining fast load times. This was solved by implementing lazy loading and image optimization techniques. Another significant challenge was designing a real-time synchronization system for inventory updates to prevent double bookings, which was resolved using Firestore's transaction capabilities.

## Outcome

The platform has successfully digitized the business operations, resulting in:
- 50% increase in customer inquiries
- 35% improvement in inventory turnover
- Streamlined management of vehicle listings and sales process
- Enhanced customer experience with real-time updates and secure transactions

The project demonstrates the effective use of modern web technologies to transform a traditional business into a digital-first operation, providing both administrative efficiency and an enhanced customer experience.
