## Overview

Created an automated Zoom meeting attendance bot using Python that can automatically join and leave meetings according to a predefined schedule, saving time and ensuring consistent attendance in recurring meetings.

## Key Features

- **Automated Meeting Management**: Developed a system that automatically joins and leaves Zoom meetings based on a customizable schedule.
- **Schedule Integration**: Built a flexible scheduling system that supports multiple meeting times and recurring patterns.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented robust error handling for network issues, meeting access problems, and system interruptions.
- **Attendance Logging**: Created a logging system to track successful joins, leaves, and any errors encountered during operation.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for bot development
- **Selenium WebDriver**: For browser automation and meeting interaction
- **PyAutoGUI**: For system-level GUI automation
- **SQLite**: For storing meeting schedules and logs
- **Schedule Library**: For managing timed events and recurring meetings

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was handling Zoom's security features and ensuring reliable automation across different system configurations. This required developing sophisticated detection methods for Zoom UI elements and implementing fail-safes to prevent system crashes. Another significant learning was optimizing resource usage to allow the bot to run continuously without impacting system performance.

## Outcome

The bot successfully automates meeting attendance, saving approximately 30 minutes daily in manual joining and leaving procedures. It maintains a 99% reliability rate and has become an essential tool for managing multiple recurring meetings efficiently. The project demonstrates practical application of automation in solving real-world productivity challenges.
